Building the MyGlamm website
Hello bookworms, in this blog we are going to share with you our first experience in Masai School's construct week where we tried to clone MyGlamm website which deals in different varieties of beauty products.
Short glimpse about MyGlamm website
MyGlamm is a beauty product website which deals in haircare , skincare , sanitizing care , and makeup line products. It has a unique variety of products which makes an individual look more presentable and adorable. It has product line for every skin tone and body type.

We have updated the category page as on selecting any category from skincare, haircare, makeup & sanitizing care user will get only that kind of products.
Category pageSignup/Login page:-
On signup page we have allowed user to fill his details to sign in as new user or if he/she is a registered user he/she can directly surf website just by providing his mobile number. Our page also allows user to sign in through different links of facebook or google if he/she is a user of them.
My Bag page:-
If user selects any product to buy by clicking on add to cart that particular product with specifications goes to my bag where user can modify product quantity.

payment pageContribution and Responsibilities of team members-
We have 3 members in our team-
 Suvam Adhikary , Yash Garg and Rajat Kumar
From the very first day we have started inspecting the HTML, CSS and Javascript properties of MyGlamm website because we had very less time in our hands to clone the whole website although management didn't asked us to clone each and every functionality but we tried to gave our maximum.
Suvam Adhivary had started contributing by starting the project, by making a public repository on Github. He was also the one behind major functionalities of our project.
Rajat Kumar gave us a good start as by the end of the day he completed signup/login page which sets the tone for website.
Yash Garg on the other hand had collected each and every detail of products, collected CSS functionalities for entire page .

Challenges and Difficulties:-
Like every one we also had a time management problem as we had only 6 days and one day went on collecting details and setting the tone for the project. Although we never had any communication gap but sometimes bandwidth network issues kicks us. Also in the journey of one week ,coding bugs became our most disturbing friend which always take our hours and sometimes more than a day.
Our approach to solve problems:-
Although we were not very experts in handling bugs but we always focused on things we can solve together rather than assigning it to one member from our team. We always went ahead with proper communication and plan. Our focus was to either create new or solve bug as soon as possible.
Learning and Re-learning
As we were always making mistakes we tried to solve them by learning from our failures and that dropped us in a process of learning and Re-learning from failures and mistakes. There were days where we gave our 100% and at the end of the day we created nothing but we never loose hope and tried as much as we can.
Conclusion:-
To be very honest, Construct week was like a roller coaster ride. Me and my team have messed up with our daily routines and had only one focus to create a website as perfect as we can. We didn't worked on each and every functionality but we made sure that which ever thing we are adopting we complete it. So for us it was a wonderful learning week.
Thankyou for reading.
